# Diagrams 

For the development of our software we use diagrams, 
which are made in the programme [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) with an [extension](https://github.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML) 
that makes it possible to elaborate these diagrams according to the [C4](https://c4model.com/) model.
